# Most of the time, Alpine is a great base image to start with.
# If we're building a container for Python, we use something different.
# Learn why here: https://pythonspeed.com/articles/base-image-python-docker-images/
# TLDR: Alpine is very slow when it comes to running Python!

# STEP 1: Install base image. Optimized for Python.
FROM node:16

# STEP 2: Set working directory.
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
# Create app directory

# Install app dependencies
# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
# where available (npm@5+)
COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install
# If you are building your code for production
# RUN npm ci --only=production
